It is the main cause of scattered radiation in a material. It occurs due to the interaction of the photon (x-ray or gamma) with free electrons (unattached to atoms) or loosely bound valence shell (outer shell) electrons. The resultant incident photon is scattered (changes direction) and imparts energy to the electron (recoil electron). The scattered photon will have a different wavelength (observed phenomenon) and thus a different energy (E=hc/λ). Energy and momentum are conserved in this process. The Compton effect is a partial absorption process and as the original photon has lost energy, known as Compton shift (i.e. a shift of wavelength/frequency). The wavelength change of the scattered photon can be determined by 0.024*(1- cosθ), where θ is scattered photon angle. Thus, the energy of the scattered photon decreases with increasing scattered photon angle.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_scattering https://radiopaedia.org/articles/compton-effect?lang=us\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"mechanisms/#Rayleigh-Scattering-1","page":"Mechanisms","title":"Rayleigh Scattering","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"mechanisms/#","page":"Mechanisms","title":"Mechanisms","text":"Coherent","category":"page"},{"location":"mechanisms/#Attenuations.Coherent","page":"Mechanisms","title":"Attenuations.Coherent","text":"Coherent scattering (also known as unmodified, Rayleigh, classical or elastic scattering) is one of three forms of photon interaction which occurs when the energy of the x-ray or gamma photon is small in relation to the ionization energy of the atom. It therefore occurs with low energy radiation.\n\nUpon interacting with the attenuating medium, the photon does not have enough energy to liberate the electron from its bound state (i.e. the photon energy is well below the binding energy of the electron) so no energy transfer occurs. There is no energy deposition and thus no dose resulting from coherent scattering. The only change is a change of direction (scatter) of the photon, hence 'unmodified' scatter. Coherent scattering is not a major interaction process encountered in radiography at the energies normally used.\n\nCoherent scattering varies with the atomic number of the absorber (Z) and incident photon energy (E) by Z/E².\n\nhttps://radiopaedia.org/articles/coherent-scattering\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Attenuations:-Mass/Linear-X-ray-Attenuation-Coefficients-from-NIST-1","page":"Home","title":"Attenuations: Mass/Linear X-ray Attenuation Coefficients from NIST","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"This package is a Julia API to the NIST XCOM Database and the tabular data from the NIST Standard Reference Database 126.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"using Attenuations","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installation-1","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"using Pkg\nPkg.add(\"https://github.com/kczimm/Attenuations.jl\")\nusing Attenuations","category":"page"},{"location":"#Basic-Usage-1","page":"Home","title":"Basic Usage","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"μᵨ(Elements.Hydrogen, 1MeV, PhotoelectricAbsorption)\nμᵨ(Mixture(Dict(\"H\"=>1)), 1MeV, PhotoelectricAbsorption)\nμ(Materials.GOS, 40keV, Incoherent)\nμᵨ(Compound(\"H2O\"), 10keV)\n\nenergies = 20keV:1keV:160keV\nμ(Materials.water, energies)","category":"page"},{"location":"#XCOM-database-1","page":"Home","title":"XCOM database","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The XCOM database can generate mass attenuation coefficients for:","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Element\nCompound\nMixture","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Element\nCompound\nMixture","category":"page"},{"location":"#Attenuations.Element","page":"Home","title":"Attenuations.Element","text":"Element\n\nAn element of the periodic table.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Attenuations.Compound","page":"Home","title":"Attenuations.Compound","text":"Compound\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Attenuations.Mixture","page":"Home","title":"Attenuations.Mixture","text":"Mixture\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Elements-1","page":"Home","title":"Elements","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The Elements and their properties provided by NIST (table 1) are available in the exported Elements named tuple.
